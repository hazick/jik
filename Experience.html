			<br><br>
			<p>This time is also one of the memorable experience for me in my secondary school. At this time, it was the big event which is STEM program for science students. I can follow them because they want to find someone that can design and they thought it was me at first. But Alhamdulillah, our school managed to get the second places from 20 schools that compete in this competition. This is the most memorable because i can know what is terrarium and science concept.</p>
